# concord4-rs

A Rust library to interact with the Concord4 Alarm Panel via an Interlogix SuperBus 2000 serial connection.

## Installation (not published yet)

```sh
cargo add concord4
```

## Usage

coming soon (i promise)

## Features

- `json` - enables serde_json support for the data structures - you can then use .to_json()

## Examples

See my project [concord4ws](https://github.com/JoeyEamigh/concord4ws) for a full example of how to use this library. That project is a full websocket server that can be used to interact with the alarm panel.
